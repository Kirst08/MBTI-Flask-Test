Input:
User responses are sent to the backend as a JSON object via a POST request.

Processing:
Responses are summed to obtain a total score.

Index Calculation:
An index is calculated based on the score divided by the maximum possible score range (300 / len(results)).

Result Determination:
The calculated index is used to select the corresponding MBTI personality type from the predefined results list.

Output:
The result is returned to the frontend as a JSON object containing the determined MBTI personality type.

This process ensures that the application accurately calculates the user's MBTI personality type based on their test responses, providing an interactive and personalized experience.
