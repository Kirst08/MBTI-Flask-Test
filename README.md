### MBTI Personality Test Calculation Process

**Input:**
User responses are sent to the backend as a JSON object via a POST request.

**Processing:**
Responses are summed to obtain a total score reflecting the user's choices.

**Index Calculation:**
An index is calculated based on the score divided by the maximum possible score range (`300 / len(results)`), ensuring a normalized value.

**Result Determination:**
The calculated index is used to select the corresponding MBTI personality type from the predefined results list. This list includes:

- 'ISTJ', 'ISFJ', 'INFJ', 'INTJ',
- 'ISTP', 'ISFP', 'INFP', 'INTP',
- 'ESTP', 'ESFP', 'ENFP', 'ENTP',
- 'ESTJ', 'ESFJ', 'ENFJ', 'ENTJ'

**Output:**
The determined MBTI personality type is returned to the frontend as a JSON object, providing a personalized result based on the user's test responses.

This process ensures the application accurately calculates and delivers the user's MBTI personality type, enhancing the interactive experience of the personality test.
